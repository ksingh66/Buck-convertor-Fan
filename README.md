# Outline
 We power a fan motor with a PWM controlled MOSFET that takes power from our buck convertor. We build both the 555 timer based PWM signal as well as the buck convertor. **View the BOM for parts to buy**.
 The DPDT switch we use to power this fan allows us to control which direction the fan rotates in also.

## Design for 555 timer PWM
 Important to note that instead of the LED we will supply power to a MOSFET

### Soldered version 
Adjusting the blue dial adjusts the LED's brightness.

## Design for Buck convertor 
Due to my EAGLE subscription running out, I can only show this design by pictures of the board. However the schematic design is still uploaded to be used.
